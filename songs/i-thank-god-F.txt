{comment: Verse 1}
[1]Wandering into the night
[1]Wanting a place to hide
This weary [4]soul, [1]this bag of bones
[1]And I tried with all my might
[1]But I just can't win the fight
I'm slowly [4]drifting, a v[1]agabond
And [5]just when I ran [6m]out of road
I [4]met a man I [1]didn't know
And [5]He told me that [6m]I was not al[4]one
 
{comment: Chorus}
He [1]picked me up
[2m7]Turned me around
[1/3]Placed my feet on [4]solid ground
I thank the [6m]Master
I thank the [4]Savior

Because He [1]healed my heart
He [2m7]changed my name
For[1/3]ever free, I'm [4]not the same
I thank the [6m]Master
I thank the [4]Savior
I thank [1]God
 
{comment: Verse 2}
I [1]cannot dеny what I see
Got [1]no choice but to believе
My doubts are [4]burning
Like ashes in the [1]wind
So, [1]so long to my old friends
[1]Burden and bitterness
You can just keep it [4]moving
Nah, you ain't welcome [1]here
From [5]now till I walk the [6m]streets of gold
I'll [4]sing of how you [1]saved my soul
This [5]wayward son has [6m]found his way back [4]home

[1]Hell lost another one
[1]I am free, I am free, I am free

[5]Hell lost another one
